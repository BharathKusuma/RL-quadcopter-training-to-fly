# Reinforcement Learning: Teaching a Quadcopter to FLy
## Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree
Training a quadcopter to fly by using reinforcement learning.
# How to run:
1) Install pip
2) Install jupyter notebooks through pip in the command line: "pip3 install jupyter"
3) Clone this repo
4) Move into this repo in the command line
5) Run "jupyter notebook" in the command line
6) You can run the notebook by just running all the blocks of code to see the statistics of how well the drone would perform
7) * Alternatively, you can run "python physics_sim.py" and you can see the visualization of how well the drone would perform
*if you use the simulator, you don't need to install or run jupyter notebooks
